How do we:

- Make workers and citizens **future-fit?**
- Create **job-ready** young people out of a broken education system?
- Develop **talent pipelines** that will increase our competitiveness?
- Incentivise a **learning culture** in our organisations?
- Retain employees with **growth mindsets?** 
- **Reskill** aging workforces? 
- **Engage** and educate customers?
- Stay **relevant** ourselves?

All CluedUp presenters are doers. They present 'action studies', so that delegates get practical insights about cutting-edge projects tackling:

- Productive **gamification** 
- Scaffolding for **leadership development**
- Proxies for **potential**
- **Teaming** humans with AI
- **Teaching coding** to youth who have failed maths

… and other exciting experiments
